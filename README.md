**NovaGraphix** is a professional software production company. It purses the new technological innovation of the high-end graphics and computer simulation.

## Introduction
- Go beyond all your expectations with NovaGraphix
- We are experts that open up new/extended graphics for you.
- Born in 2015, NovaGraphix is a forward-looking company focused on building digital products and solutions that are needed for the 21st century. As a provider with global information & technology, we will connect you to a dynamic network of data, ideas, and people, accurately delivering science & engineering insights to customers around the world.
- Our mission is to invite you to the new world through our high-end graphics and computer simulation technology.

## Challenge & Opportunities
- Trends
    - Streaming platforms will explode in the 5G era.
    - The main trend in the 5G era is that big data flows on cloud streaming platforms.
- Challenge
    - The use of 3D models will gradually increase as big data in film, games, architecture, landscape, online shopping, and VR.
- Opportunities   
    The digital paradigm is rapidly changing
    - from the age of enterprise making contents (using expensive hardware and complicated development tools or on top of their development environment)
    - to the age of consumer making contents (using cloud cross-platforms).
- Solution
    - Here we will provide a free authoring tool that allows consumers to easily create 3D models to be used in the movies, games and online shopping mall, and
    - We will also build a 3D digital marketplace so that these 3D models can be bought or sold.

## Experience
- Past prjects
    - **EcoPlan**: Orthopedic insole design system that enables users to deforms a standard insole to the fully customized insole for a patient
    - **EcoLast**: Shoelast design system that provides modeling functions that allow users to manipulate a shoe last object for manufacturing orthopedic shoe lasts
    - **NatureWorks**: Web app specialized in nature rendering & processing (nature graphics engine)
    - **ViewWorks**: Web app specialized in visualizing any 3D models (3D model viewer)
    - **MedicalWorks**: Web app specialized in medical imaging & volume visualization (advanced toolkit for anatomical engineering)
- Ongoing Projects
    - **VoxelMesh**: 3D WebGL-based voxel engine that creates 3D voxel models with a concise voxel structure
    - **Voxel Metaverse**: A digital world made up of voxels, which can be used to build games or virtual worlds
    - **3D Digital Marketplace**: Web-based digital trading market that buys and sells 3D digital models including polygonal & voxel models

## Development Plans
- Advanced technology in development
    - GPU-based parallel computing on the web
    - Machine learning (deep learning) for image processing and computer visions
- Web-based Products (planned)
    - **GameWorks**: online multiplayer shooting game engine
    - **SketchWorks**: 2D drawing engine for visual art as like Apple procreate
    - **SimulationWorks**: GPU-accelerated computing engine
    - **ImageWorks**: machine learning-based image processing engine
    - **VisionWorks**: deep learning-based computer vision engine
    - **ShoeWorks**: fully customized online shoe/insole design software

## Business Model (Profit-making Plan)
- **3D model marketplace & community platform** (e.g., sketchfab), which is a service that arranges the connection between the person who needs 3D model files and the person who creates them.
- **3D shopping displayer**, which is a service to visualize 3D models instead of 2D images to give a real sense in the online shopping mall. Various options for products will be also displayed for a consumer to simulate exactly what he/she wants.
- **Virtual reality showroom** (e.g., IKEA), which is a service that uses the immersive power of virtual reality to offer an innovative 3D product experience. With new ways of exploration and visualization, customers can bring your company rooms to life â€“ opening their minds and home to new possibilities.
